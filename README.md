# Predictive Insights from Randomized Data: A DIY Linear Modeling Approach
Utilizing risk-challenge data, develop a Linear Model to predict y values, identifying x coefficients. 
Assess predictive power and conduct hypothesis test for statistical significance at Î± = 0.05. 
Then, fit to a non-linear model (Gaussian Process Regressor) and see if it's 
statistically significant at the same predictive power. 
The data in the CSV file consists of data points that were randomly generated by some function.
